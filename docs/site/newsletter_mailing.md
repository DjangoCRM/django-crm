# CRM email marketing

The **Massmail application** is a specially designed component of the [Mailing CRM](https://github.com/DjangoCRM/django-crm){target="_blank"} platform
that empowers businesses to manage and execute company newsletters efficiently.
It provides tools to create, manage and send marketing emails to [contact persons](operator_and_sales_manager_roles.md#object-of-company-contact-persons), leads, and companies (recipients)
directly from your CRM system. Learn more about [CRM and email marketing](https://djangocrm.github.io/info/features/massmail-app-features){target="_blank"}.

The Massmail application requires:

- the existence of recipients in the CRM database
- configured [email accounts](setting_up_email_accounts.md) for sales managers *(marked "Massmail")*

Mailings from the **main** sales manager account are sent only to **VIP recipients** to prevent the main account from being caught by **spam filters**.  
Use the **Action menu** on the Contact persons, Companies and Leads pages to **mark recipients as VIP**.  
For other recipients, it is recommended to set up additional email accounts.

## Massmail settings

The settings are available only to administrators *(superusers)*.  
`(ADMIN site) Home > Settings > Massmail Settings`

!!! Note

    Changed in v1.4:  
    The settings have been moved from the `settings.py` file to the Admin web UI.

### Use of business time

The application allows you to send mail only during working hours *(which can be changed)*.  
To do this, check the box "Use working hours", then the mailing will also not be carried out on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

### Unsubscribe from the mailing list

The application provides recipients with an opportunity to unsubscribe from mailings.  
To prevent revealing your CRM site's web address, create a page on your company's website to which users clicking the **UNSUBSCRIBE** button will be redirected.
This page should show a message that the user unsubscribed successfully.  
The address of this page must be specified in the field: `URL to unsubscribe`.  
Each message template must contain the **UNSUBSCRIBE** button with `unsubscribe_url` tag (`href="{{ unsubscribe_url }}"`).

## How to create email campaign

There are two ways to create a mailing list.  
But in any case, you first need to prepare a message for the mailing:  
`(CRM site) Home > Mass mail › Email Messages`

Also prepare a signature *(if necessary)* and indicate its ID in the message:  
`(CRM site) Home > Mass mail › Signatures`

The **first way** is to simply select recipients, for example, on the company list page,
and then use the **Action menu** to create a mailing.
This method is easier.

The **second way** is to use the **Create Mailing button** and specify the values of all filters.  
This method is indispensable when you are dealing with a huge number of recipients.  

!!! Important

    The sales manager can send out mailings only to the recipients assigned to him and only through the mail accounts assigned to him.

In the form that opens:

- select the message ID
- click the Save and continue editing button to get a preview of the message
- change status to Active if everything is fine
- click the Save button

The progress of mailings is displayed on the mailing list page. The data is updated when the page is refreshed. The first sends will be visible within 5 minutes.

### Responses to newsletter

In order not to create a mess, CRM automatically imports only emails related to Requests and Deals *(they are provided with a ticket)*.
If a commercial request comes in response to a newsletter, it can be imported using the corresponding button on the page of Requests, and then all subsequent correspondence will be imported into CRM.

!!! Warning

    Do not use this application to send spam!
