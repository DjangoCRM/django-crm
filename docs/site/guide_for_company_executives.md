# Key Django CRM Modules for Company Managers

For company managers, certain modules of Django CRM are particularly valuable.
They provide tools not only for overseeing sales but also for coordinating the work of different departments,
improving communication, and making data-driven decisions.
The modules most often used at the managerial level are the **CRM Task Manager**, the **CRM Module**, and **CRM Analytics**.

!!! Note

    By default, company executives have access to all sections. 
    If some sections or objects are not of interest, they can be hidden using individual settings - 
    contact your CRM administrator.

## CRM Task Manager

This module goes beyond sales and can be used by all company personnel.
It helps assign, organize, and track tasks across different teams and departments.
In addition to standard task management, it supports **office memos (service notes)**,
allowing employees to share internal updates, instructions, or approvals in a structured way.
Whether itâ€™s handling customer requests, coordinating project activities, or managing internal workflows,
the task manager provides transparency and accountability across the entire organization.

## CRM Module

At the core of Django CRM, this module centralizes all customer-related information.
Managers and sales teams can monitor leads, track opportunities, and oversee client communications in one place.
Using the data collected here, **sales managers can launch targeted email campaigns via the Mass Mail application directly from the CRM**,
ensuring outreach is relevant and timely. This integration supports both daily operations and long-term customer relationship strategies.

With these insights, managers can make informed decisions, adjust strategies, and set realistic goals based on actual performance.
