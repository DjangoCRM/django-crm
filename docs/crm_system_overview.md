# Django-CRM Overview

Free CRM management [software](https://github.com/DjangoCRM/django-crm/) is designed to optimize the management of customer interactions, streamline processes, and enhance data-driven decision-making.  
The customer crm software leverages the Django framework, ensuring ease of development, customization, and deployment.

Below is a comprehensive overview of its key features and functionalities:

## Key Features of all Applications in the CRM software package

The **CRM app** in Django-CRM is the central hub for managing customer interactions, commercial requests, and sales processes.  
Its features are designed to streamline operations and provide actionable insights for sales managers, operators, and administrators.

### User Access and Roles

- **Role-Based Access Control to Sections and Objects**: Users' access to various sections and objects within the CRM is determined by their assigned roles.  
  These roles come with specific rights (permissions), which can be either permanent or dynamic.  
  For example, the author of a memo can view it but may lose the right to edit or delete it after it has been reviewed by a superior.
- **Custom Role Management**: Administrators can create new user roles with tailored permissions, allowing for highly customized access control based on the organization's hierarchy.

### Filters and Sorting

- **Filter Panel**: The filter panel, located on the right side of each object list page, allows users to narrow down the displayed data.  
  Some filters come with default values (e.g., only showing active tasks). Filters can be customized and saved for future use.
- **Advanced Sorting**: In addition to basic sorting by column headers, users can apply multi-level sorting for more complex data views.  
  For instance, tasks can be sorted first by due date and then by priority level.
  
### Object Identification and Search

- **ID-Based Search**: Objects can be quickly located by entering "ID" followed by the object's number (e.g., ID1234).
- **Ticket-Based Search**: Commercial requests and related objects as Emails, Deals, etc. can be found by their unique ticket identifier by typing "ticket:" followed by the value (e.g., ticket:tWRMaat3n8Y).
- **Automatic Search Algorithms**: The CRM uses several identifiers (e.g., first name, email, phone number) to match and link objects, such as requests to companies and contact persons.  
  The system automatically suggests related entities during searches.

### Internal Chat Integration

Facilitate communication within the team through integrated chat.

## Navigation and Usability

  CRM System notifications are displayed to provide a snapshot of recent activities and tasks.

  Tooltips appear when hovering over elements like icons or buttons, offering immediate explanations. A detailed **user manual** is also accessible within the system.
