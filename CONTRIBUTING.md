  <details>
    <summary>How to add a new language or improve the existing translation?</summary>
    Activate a virtual environment (if used) and install the necessary package:  
  
    - Install Rosetta:

      ```cmd
      pip install django-rosetta
      ```

    - Add the following to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in the `local_settings.py` (if used) or `settings.py` file:

      ```python
      'rosetta',
      ```
      
      Add a new language (if necessary).

      ```python
      LANGUAGES = [
          ("<locale_name>", _("<language_name>")),
          ("en", _("English")),
      ]
      ```
      A locale name, either a language specification of the form **ll** or a combined language and country specification of the form **ll_CC**.  
    
     - Run the following command to create a new language file or update an existing one:
    
      ```cmd
      python manage.py makemessages -l <locale_name>
      ```

    - Run Django server:
        ```cmd
      python manage.py runserver --settings=webcrm.local_settings
      ```
      or 
      ```cmd
      python manage.py runserver 
      ```
    - Open the http://localhost:8000/rosetta/files/project/ in your browser.
    - Select a language and edit the translation.
    - Save the changes (to see the result on the CRM website, you need to restart the server).
    - Create a pull request with the modified files.

### Writing Code

The <a href="https://github.com/DjangoCRM/django-crm" title="Client relationship software" target="_blank">Django-CRM project</a> aims to deliver high-level CRM software while keeping it easy to customize, develop, and maintain.  
To achieve this, it follows a key principle: leverage Django's built-in capabilities whenever possible.  
There are at least two good reasons to do so:

- Developers familiar with Django framework will find the CRM code understandable.
- Developers new to Django will benefit from Django's excellent documentation.

We are focused on improving the functionality that has already been created. 
Making it more convenient and understandable for a wide audience of users.  
But now we are also ready to add new features.

- It's easier to start by working with issues marked with a <a href="https://github.com/DjangoCRM/django-crm/labels/good%20first%20issue" target="_blank">‚Äúgood first issue‚Äù</a> label. They are supplied with instructions.
- Create a draft PR when starting work on bigger changes for discussion and assistance.
- A **Task-board** and **Roadmap** are available for **contributors** to obtain additional information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository follows the "[GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)" - anything in the main branch is deployable.  
> **Run tests before creating a Pull Request!**
